# vprof

vprof is a Python package providing rich and interactive visualizations for
various Python program characteristics such as running time and memory usage.
It supports Python 3.4+ and distributed under BSD license.

The project is in active development and some of its features might not work as
expected.

## Contributing
All contributions are highly encouraged! You can add new features,
report and fix existing bugs and write docs and tutorials.
Feel free to open an issue or send a pull request!

## Prerequisites
Dependencies to build `vprof` from source code:
 * Python 3.4+
 * `pip`
 * `npm` >= 3.3.12

`npm` is required to build `vprof` from sources only.

## Dependencies
All Python and `npm` module dependencies are listed in `package.json` and
`requirements.txt`.

## Installation
`vprof` can be installed from PyPI

```sh
pip install vprof
```

To build `vprof` from sources, clone this repository and execute

```sh
python3 setup.py deps_install && python3 setup.py build_ui && python3 setup.py install
```

To install just `vprof` dependencies, run

```sh
python3 setup.py deps_install
```

## Usage

```sh
vprof -c <config> <src>
```
`<config>` is a combination of supported modes:

* `c` - CPU flame graph  ⚠️ **Not available for windows [#62](https://github.com/nvdv/vprof/issues/62)**

Shows CPU flame graph for `<src>`.

* `p` - profiler

Runs built-in Python profiler on `<src>` and displays results.

* `m` - memory graph

Shows objects that are tracked by CPython GC and left in memory after code
execution. Also shows process memory usage after execution of each line of `<src>`.

* `h` - code heatmap

Displays all executed code of `<src>` with line run times and execution counts.

`<src>` can be Python source file (e.g. `testscript.py`) or path to package
(e.g. `myproject/test_package`).

To run scripts with arguments use double quotes

```sh
vprof -c cmh "testscript.py --foo --bar"
```

Modes can be combined

```sh
vprof -c cm testscript.py
```

`vprof` can also profile functions. In order to do this,
launch `vprof` in remote mode:

```sh
vprof -r
```

`vprof` will open new tab in default web browser and then wait for stats.

To profile a function run

```python
from vprof import runner

def foo(arg1, arg2):
    ...

runner.run(foo, 'cmhp', args=(arg1, arg2), host='localhost', port=8000)
```

where `cmhp` is profiling mode, `host` and `port` are hostname and port of
`vprof` server launched in remote mode. Obtained stats will be rendered in new
tab of default web browser, opened by `vprof -r` command.

`vprof` can save profile stats to file and render visualizations from
previously saved file.

```sh
vprof -c cmh src.py --output-file profile.json
```

writes profile to file and

```sh
vprof --input-file profile.json
```
renders visualizations from previously saved file.

Check `vprof -h` for full list of supported parameters.

To show UI help, press `h` when visualizations are displayed.

Also you can check `examples` directory for more profiling examples.

## Testing

```sh
python3 setup.py test_python && python3 setup.py test_javascript && python3 setup.py e2e_test
```
